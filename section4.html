              <h4>Product Positioning Sprint</h4>
              <h3>Project Website Made With Stackbit</h3>
              <p class="blackbox">I wasn't planning on attending this sprint until I got an email from Section 4 that
                  I was able to attend any sprint for the rest of the year - included with my membership which was already
                  a scholarship from my favorite company. Needless to say, this covered a difficult and abstract topic
                  that I think may have been one of the most important topics for me to end up exploring in business.
                <br>
                  <br>
                  I thoroughly enjoyed this sprint for many reasons, but I had such a great time learning because of April
                  Dunford. She is a very intelligent, humorous, and thoughtful person, who made this topic easier for me
                  to understand. I strongly recommend anyone who needs help with product positioning to purchase and read
                  her book <i>Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It</i> -
                  I promise you will be entertained.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p class="blackbox">For my sprint project, I first considered Twilio, but I realized that they
              really kind of had their positioning nailed down. I had recently found this company Stackbit and found
              their product fascinating. I also saw that they were hiring, so I thought that this might be a good way to show
              that I understand their product and also for me to apply these principles to a product that I believe coudl be
              improved with the topics and frameworks used in this course.
                  <br>
                  <br>
              Since Stackbit is a website creation platform and CMS, I thought it would be fun to use their product to present
              my project. I got a stomach bug the last day this project was due and I didn't finish polishing off the presentation.
              If there are some things that seem to be missing, I am literally adding them right now as I finish styling and
              polishing off the website.
            <br>

              I hope you enjoy this project as much I enjoyed this sprint and creating my project. Feel free to reach out with
              any questions or requests to learn more!</p>

        <h4>Section4 Project</h4>
        <h3>Customer Centered Innovation Sprint</h3>
        <p class="blackbox">
          I am stil participating in an incredible Two Week Customer-Centered Innovation sprint through <a href="https://www.section4.com/" alt="section4 elite business education">Section4</a>.
          <br>
          For my project, I decided to recreate my brand with the tools I am learning in the sprint.
            Really it felt more like creating my brand.
          <br>
          The customer base I'm hoping to attract are employers,
            businesses that need freelance web developers, and entrepreneurs who use software.
          My brand, @GeauxWeisbeck4,
            wants to create a pleasant experience for people who visit my webpage when they seek my full stack developer
          skillset and experience.
            I designed the first round of my website to include the bare minimum,
            tidy up my GitHub (feedback from Career Coach),
          and seek freelance or full-time work to get software building experience.
          <br>
          My Web of Abstraction was designed
            to create ideas
            from laddering out on a problem my customers have and laddering back in with the feedback I got.
          Laddering out was done by navigating my community network available to me.
            I met with peers and a career coach to consult on how to take the next
          step in my career.
            I met with a Section 4 Membership Thought Partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonpschoch/" alt="Jason Schoch LinkedIn Page">Jason Schoch</a> who gave me the advice
          to tidy up my resume, GitHub, and find freelance work.
            I also decided to tidy up my personal page.
          <br>
          Web of Abstraction<br>
          How? With Github and Resume<br>
          How? Publish your projects<br>
          How? Get noticed with your work<br>
          Customer problem: Finding Andrew to hire for work<br>
          How to solve: Build solid Personal Page and tidy up Github.

          Input back down the web<br>
          Jason: Tidy up your resume<br>
          Peer: Focus on learning how software is made<br>
          Research: Build your community<br>

          Jobs to be done<br>
          Build resume and tidy up Github<br>

          I will use the RIME framework moving forward to test and asses ideas.
            You can see how I have it set up below.
            You can also see the results of my project on this personal page.
        </p>




        <h4>RIME Framework</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Reach: My Community, the communities of my own network.</li>
          <li>Impact: Find a way to discover people who are in need of a freelance Developer</li>
          <li>Monetization: Creating a Newsletter - have a free personal newsletter and then a weekly paid one
